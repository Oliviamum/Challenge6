# Challenge6
Purpose of the project 

Short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project: 
This project is part of the requirement for the fufillment of the bootcamp project. It is also a practice and demonstration of my understanding of application of Javascript to make things work in the webpage.

This challenge requires me to create an application that i can use for a timed quiz.
it is a quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
So that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
It requires a button to start and prompts to have questions appear.

-Practically, this application can be used for setting any question or forms t o be used to gather information from any one. 
As a teacher, this is one of the things i have found very fascinating especially using it in setting formative assessment for my students, preparing survey questions. also customising it to what ever i need it for and so many more to do with it but this is just for a start. 

It is important for me to work on this project in preparation of building my own project for showcase to employers while seeking a job in front end web designing. The project requires me to display my skills and what i have learnt in making things work using Java Script.

Motivation? I am excited to continue learning html, CSS and Javascript. These are not only good for webdevelopment but they are skills when learnt will be used in a lot of different areas in academics and also business. I am also learning to become a web developer as these are essentials skills for it.

What i learnt? I learnt how to write some codes in Javascript, build my own programmegit commit - of things i want to use it for.
